   - Identified the highest wicket-taker across all matches.

2. **First Inning Score vs. Second Inning Score**:
   - Analyzed the relationship between scores in the first and second innings.
   - Visualized the data using scatter and line plots.

3. **First Inning Wickets vs. Second Inning Wickets**:
   - Analyzed the relationship between wickets fallen in the first and second innings.
   - Visualized the data using line plots.

4. **Top Performers in the Final**:
   - Identified the best bowler and batsman in the final match.

5. **Average Win Margins Over Time**:
   - Calculated and visualized the average win margins over time using line graphs.

6. **Top Scorer Occurrences by Venue**:
   - Analyzed and listed the occurrences of top scorers at different venues.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations to aid in understanding the data:
